User first needs to connect a particular WIFI like of an office or a collage to login.
WIFI name can be set in code Like in my case it is 'KANCHAN'.

After that when user login through fingerprint sensor succesfully,date-time and Android-id of user's device will be stored on server using php file as backend.
